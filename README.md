# codeQuiz

## Description
In this assignment we started from scratch in building an quiz app. We were given functional requirements and a gif demo of the desired functionality but needed to implement the HTML, CSS,
and Javascript functionality entirely on our own. The assignment incorporated event listeners, local storage, intervals/timers, creating and removing HTML elements, decision logic, and data structures.
The end result is a functioning game where a user is shown a series of questions, answers the questions, is told whether their answer is right or wrong, sees a final score at the end, add their score to a persisting list, and 
can ultimately delete the lsit of scores and start over again.
